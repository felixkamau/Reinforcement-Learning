Introduction to RL

1.What is reinforcement learning: This is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive enviroment by trial and erroe using feedback from it's action in the enviroment.

Formulating a simple RL problem
Environment — Physical world in which the agent operates

State — Current situation of the agent

Reward — Feedback from the environment

Policy — Method to map agent’s state to actions

Value — Future reward that an agent would receive by taking an action in a particular state
